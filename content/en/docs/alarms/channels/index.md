{{% pageinfo %}}
A channel defines one or more method of delivering alert notifications to external systems.  
{{% /pageinfo %}}

### Notification Delivery Channels

- Email - One or more email address (comma separated) that will receive messages from alerts@trustgrid.io

- PagerDuty - Trustgrid will generate an incident via the PagerDuty API if provided a valid API routing key.

- OpsGenie - Trustgrid will generate an incident via the OpsGenie API if provided a valid API key with read and create and update permissions.

{{<alert>}} For both PagerDuty and OpsGenie the integration will automatically resolve issues if an [event]({{<ref "docs/alarms/events" >}}) occurs that negates the initial triggering event. For example, if an [event]({{<ref "docs/alarms/events" >}}) is triggered by a Node Disconnect and the [node]({{<ref "docs/nodes" >}}) reconnects, the Node Connect [event]({{<ref "docs/alarms/events" >}}) will resolve the incident via the API. {{</alert>}}

- Slack - Trustgrid can post the [event]({{<ref "docs/alarms/events" >}}) data to a configured channel via a webhook.

- Microsoft Teams - Trustgrid can post [event]({{<ref "docs/alarms/events" >}}) data to a configured Teams channel via an incoming webhook

{{<alert>}} Only a single Slack or Teams channel can be targeted by a Trustgrid channel. However, you can create multiple Trustgrid channels if you wish to post the [event]({{<ref "docs/alarms/events" >}}) data to more than one Slack/Teams channel. {{</alert>}}

### Example Event Data

The [event]({{<ref "docs/alarms/events" >}}) data is delivered in JSON, as shown below, which depending on the integration can allow for additional parsing.
