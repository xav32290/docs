A node is an instance of software used for building connections, managing compute resources, and deploying software.

 A node can be installed on a hardware appliance, as a virtual appliance (Vsphere and Hyper-V), and deployed in a public cloud (Amazon AMI, Google, Microsoft). There are three main types of nodes - Edge, Gateway, and Management. 
 
 Edge nodes create TLS tunnels to all gateway nodes provisioned in a domain. Edge nodes also create TLS tunnels to Management nodes operated by Trustgrid. 
 
 Gateway nodes accept incoming tunnels from Edge nodes. 
 
 All Trustgrid nodes run on a hardened Ubuntu operating system. Nodes are managed through the Trustgrid portal or via the API (requires authentication token). A local UI exists to support the reconfiguration of an ethernet interface and diagnostic/network tests prior to connection to the Portal.
