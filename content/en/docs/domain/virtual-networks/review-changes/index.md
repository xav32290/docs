Because changes to a domain [virtual network]({{<ref "docs/domain/virtual-networks" >}}) affect _all_ [nodes]({{<ref "docs/nodes" >}}), [domain]({{<ref "docs/domain" >}}) configuration changes must be reviewed before applied, and are applied all at once.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

After making changes to a [virtual network]({{<ref "docs/domain/virtual-networks" >}}), you can review outstanding changes. A list of changes will show who made each change, with a before/after table if appropriate.

Individual changes can be rejected by clicking the delete icon at the top.

Once changes are applied, outstanding changes will disappear from the review page, and [nodes]({{<ref "docs/nodes" >}}) will receive the configuration updates.
