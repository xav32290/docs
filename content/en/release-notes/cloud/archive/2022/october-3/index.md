## Repository Performance Improvements

This release includes a significant overhaul of the the repository control plane service. This service is responsible for providing upgrade packages and pushing/pulling container images. 

## Data Plane Stats for Private and Hub Gateways

Prior to this release, viewing the Data Plane stats such as tunnel latency and [network hops]({{<ref "/tutorials/gateway-tools/monitoring-network-hops-to-peers">}} would not display. These stats will now be displayed the just like edge and public gateway stats.
