[{"body":" Trustgrid and our customers share the responsibilities of securing the Trustgrid network. Trustgrid assumes and automates a significant part of the overall security challenges. These challenges range from the cloud to the firmware on hardware appliances. Our customers are responsible for securing physical environments, identity and access management, and all security aspects of the environments where Trustgrid is installed.\nTrustgrid Secures the Cloud All cloud management components are secured and monitored by Trustgrid. This includes the hardware, software, and network for all cloud components including the Portal/Management API and other management tools. Customers are responsible for issuing credentials to the Portal for each authorized user and maintaining the security of those accounts.\nNetwork Security is a Shared Responsibility Trustgrid is responsible for the security of all data plane traffic from the time it enters a Trustgrid node until the time it exits a Trustgrid node. Customers are responsible for the security of all network traffic eggressing from any Trustgrid node.\nTrustgrid Teams with Customers for Edge Security All virtual or hardware appliances are secured by Trustgrid. Trustgrid’s ability to secure hardware is restricted to supported hardware appliances with specific exceptions. Customers are responsible for the security of the physical and logical environments into which Trustgrid is integrated.\nSecure Gateway Nodes Trustgrid customer’s should apply access controls to ingress traffic for gateway nodes. By restricting ingress access to edge nodes IP ranges the system security is improved and many common attacks easily avoided.\nEncrypt Traffic with Customer Certificates By default, Trustgrid encrypts all traffic on the data and control planes with privately issued certificates from our PKI. Customers may elect to provide their own certificates for data plane encryption ensuring Trustgrid maintains a zero-knowledge security posture of all data plane traffic.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Trustgrid and our customers share the responsibilities of securing …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/security/customer-responsibilities/","tags":["security","overview"],"title":"Customer Responsibilities"},{"body":" A Trustgrid account is necessary to use our services.

We’ve now moved most of this information to a new panel dedicated for this purpose.\nHovering over the Data Plane status indicator next to the node name still includes basic details about the number of gateways known and connected. And it includes a link to the new panel for more detail:\nClicking that link or just selecting the Data Plane panel from the left navigation bar will bring you to a new page showing much of the same detail as the previous pop-up table.\nData Plane Historical Stats You can now load historical latency data about a connection between this node and a connected gateway. Simply select the gateway from the table by clicking it, choose a start and end time and click Load.\nPortal Tool Improvements Tool Setting History A common pain point when using the tools within the Trustgrid Portal was that if you had to rerun a tool you had to reenter the values into the prompt. With this release Trustgrid is introducing an execution history that will make rerunning a tool much simpler for users.\nAs an example, if I run the Interface TCP Port Test tool for the first time, the target IP and port will be the defaults 192.168.1.1 and port 80\nIf I change these to a new IP and port and run (e.g. 172.16.22.199 and port 22) and run the tool. The next time I run the tool these settings will be populated automatically.\nAdditionally, I can click the History tab on the right to see the last few execution settings. I simply need to click apply to rerun one of the configurations listed.\nMTR Tool MTR (or my trace route) is an alternative to the traditional traceroute tool that expands on the data gathered and reported in a number of ways. It can be run interactively to run continuously until stopped, gather additional statistics, report multiple paths more clearly and more. While this tool has been available from within the Terminal for some time, Trustgrid has now made this accessible directly from the portal user interface.\nTo use this new feature, the node must be running the latest Trustgrid package version (1.5.20220215-1159) or newer\nTo run the tool, navigate to the Network → Interfaces section of a node and select the desired interface. Then click the MTR button.\nThe default settings are to target the local loopback interface IP (127.0.0.1) and run 10 times (-c 10).\nChange the target to the desired IP or host name and update the options. Some useful options include:\n-T to use TCP instead of ICMP and can be combined with -P XXXX to target a specific known listening port. This can be useful when targeting a Trustgrid gateway from and edge node. (e.g. -T -P 8443)\n-w runs MTR in wide screen reporting mode. You will not see output on the screen until the -c count has completed but the output will persist, unlike when run interactively where it is cleared from the screen at completion.\nSee the mtr man page for additional options.\nInterface Flows Tool Under the Network → Interface section you will see a new “Flows” tool listed\nTo use this new feature, the node must be running the latest Trustgrid package version (1.5.20220215-1159) or newer\nThis tool provides information about flows traversing an interface, similar to who the VPN “View Virtual Translations Table” tool shows flows traversing the VPN.\nLaunching the tool you have a number of options to filter the results. Or you can run without filters to return all flows.\nThe resulting table lists the flow found on the interface. This can be sorted by column.\nAdditionally, any active flow can be Terminated (disconnected) from within the tool. You will be prompted to confirm.\nNetwork Interface Improvements Interface Speed and Duplex The Trustgrid portal now displays the negotiated speed and duplex values:\nAnd it now allows you to change from the default Auto negotiation setting to a manual setting. This is frequently necessary when the connected port is hard set to a speed and duplex value, which breaks auto negotiation.\nAlert Improvements Alert Suppression Window Events An Alert Suppression Window prevents the Trustgrid system from sending notification to alarm channels for a scheduled period of time. This is useful for preventing noisy alerts during planned maintenance. Historically, correlating events to this time period required remembering when the maintenance occurred.\nAfter the suppression window is closed, either by cancelling or allowing it to expire, two events are created. One for the scheduled start:\nAnd another for the actual end time:\nThese events are viewable at both the node and organization level to make it easy to correlate events to the maintenance window.\nOverride Domain Level Threshold Alerts Threshold alerts, such as CPU % or latency, can be configured to apply to all nodes within a domain. But sometimes it is necessary for a specific node to have different thresholds defined. With this release, the domain thresholds can be overridden.\nIf you navigate to the Alerts panel of a node, you will see a section at the bottom titled Global Alerts. It will list all threshold alerts defined at the higher, domain level. Click the Override button to set a node specific value.\nDefine a new threshold value or duration\nAfter you click Save, the value will have a yellow square to indicate it is an override.\nThreshold Alerts Included Data Points Previously it wasn’t always clear why a threshold alert, such as an alarm regarding latency, exceeded the configured threshold. Even if you connected immediate to the device and checked the latency might have returned to normal.\nNow the JSON payload sent to alarm channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.) can include the data points used to calculate the average that exceeded the threshold. This is in a new section called details and the values are in pairs of the timestamp t (unix time) and value v (in milliseconds in the example below).\nAlert Payload ... \"details\":\t{ \"values\":\t[ {\"t\":1645664460,\"v\":1310}, {\"t\":1645664520,\"v\":1310}, {\"t\":1645664580,\"v\":31}, {\"t\":1645664640,\"v\":31}, {\"t\":1645664700,\"v\":890} ], } ...

An additional IP address is assigned as a Cluster Virtual IP address that can move between the nodes if failover occurs.\nCertain settings such as network services and VPN settings can be configured for the cluster and these settings will override the individual node’s configuration.\nFormerly the active member was referred to as the “master.” We are in the process moving to the terms active and standby. This documentation will use those terms but elements in the UI may retain the master term. Requirements Nodes in the cluster must be using the same model of appliances Nodes must be able to create direct TCP connections with each other Nodes should be at the same site or have high-bandwidth, high-reliability, low-latency connections between the devices Active Member Determination The active member of a cluster is determined by the following factors:\nCluster heartbeat communication Cluster mode Configured master Cluster member health Cluster Heartbeat Communication Cluster members utilize a direct TCP connection to each other to determine if their partner is online and share their health status. Each node will listen on a configured heartbeat IP and port, while at the same time connecting to their partner’s configured heartbeat IP and port.\nLocal ACLs allow only the partner cluster member to connect to the listening port. Heartbeat communication is configured on each node’s cluster page.\nCluster Mode A cluster can be configured in two different modes to determine what happens when a failed member returns to healthy status:\nAutomatic Failback (Default) - In this mode the member set as the Configured Master (see below) will maintain the active/master role as long as it is online and healthy. Manual Failback - In this mode, the active/master role only moves if either the current holder fails or the configured master is changed Consider a cluster with members named Node1, the configured master, and Node2.\nEvent Automatic Failback - Active Member Manual Failback - Active Member Initial State Node1 Node1 Node1 unhealthy/offline Node2 Node2 Node1 returns to healthy/online Node1 Node2 Configured Master Each cluster will have one configured or preferred active member. This is reflected in the overview section.\nA node may be designated as the preferred active member by selecting the node and clicking the “Set as Master” action\nThe Configured Master field will change immediately, but the Current Master may take a minute to reflect the change as the nodes process the change and notify the control plane.\nCluster Member Health There may be situations where both cluster members are online and can communicate with each other, but external conditions exist that make a node unsuitable to hold the active role. The Trustgrid node service monitors for such conditions and will make a node as unhealthy if one occurs. The node will release the active role and its standby member will take over if it is online and healthy.\nWhen the condition clears the node will declare itself healthy and inform its partner member. Depending on the cluster mode it may reclaim the active role.\nCluster Member Health Conditions Interface Link (Up/Down) State - Any interface configured with an IP address in the Trustgrid is monitored for a successful connection to another network device\nExample: In a two-interface setup it would be possible for the LAN interface to become unplugged but the node to remain online from the cloud and data plane perspective. However, the lack of LAN connectivity would prevent the node from delivering any Trustgrid services to that network Note: If only a single node has an interface configured, such as an alternate MPLS path, Trustgrid support can configure it to be ignored for triggering. Upstream Internet Issues - If a Trustgrid node is unable to build connections to both the Trustgrid control plane AND data plane connections to its gateways the node will be marked as unhealthy. This does require all the connections to be failing before it is triggered\nExample: If an upstream internet provider or device experiences failure the node will not be able to provide any services. Layer 4 (L4 Proxy) Service Health Check - TCP L4 Proxy Services can be configured to regularly perform health checks to confirm a successful connection can be made. If these checks fail 5 times in a row the service will mark the cluster member as unhealthy.\nExample: If each cluster member’s LAN interface is connected to a different switch and one switch fails that member will be unable to connect to any IP:ports dependent on that path.\nUse caution before configuring multiple services with health checks. This could create a situation where both nodes declare themselves unhealthy because a single service is failing if the server providing the service goes offline. Cluster Member Shared Configuration Cluster members can share the configuration for the following services:\nNetworking Interfaces Interface routes Cluster VIP (supported in on-premise, traditional network environment) AWS/Azure/GCP route table entries VPN Tunnels VRFs ZTNA gateway endpoints Layer 4 services and connectors Compute Container and command definitions Resource limits Tags Tags are visible at the bottom of the overview page for the resource.\nModifying Tags To add a tag:\nClick Add Tag.\nA new row will appear at the bottom of the tags table. There will be a list of existing tag names for your organization. You can filter the list by typing in the field. You can either select an existing tag name, or create a new one by typing it out in full and then selecting New selection: tagName.\nNext move to the values field. As with the name, existing values will be listed. To enter a new value type it in completely.\nClick Save\nTag rows can be edited in-place. Change the name or value, then click Save.\nTo remove a tag, click the red X next to the tag name, then click Save.\nApplying a Tag Filter to the Clusters Table The clusters table can also be filtered to only show clusters with a specific tag name:value.\nOn the clusters table click Actions and select Add Tag Filter from the drop-down menu. After clicking Add Tag Filter, select the tag-name field and you will see a list of tag-names available. Select the desired tag. You can also start typing to filter what tag names are shown.\nSelect the tag value field and you will see a list of available values. Select the desired value.\n(Optional) Click Add Tag Filter to include an additional filter. Note that the two filters will be applied using AND only clusters with both tag name:value combinations matching will be shown.\nClick Apply Tag Filter and the table will only show matching clusters.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" A cluster is a pair of nodes that share configuration and an …","ref":"/docs/docs/clusters/","tags":["cluster"],"title":"Clusters"},{"body":" Trustgrid allows importing of self-managed certificates that can encrypt traffic for both the Trustgrid mesh network (via the Gateway) and ZTNA applications.\nAdding a Certificate Field Name Description Certificate body The certificate body, in PEM format.

Any Docker container is supported with the exception of containers that require root level access.\nThe container can be attached to both the local and virtual network space which allows both local and remote resources to communicate with the container. For example an API could be deployed on a Trustgrid Gateway which sends API Calls via the virtual network space to a container running on a Trustgrid Edge Node. The API call could then be translated to make a call to a database running on the local network and passed back up to the gateway host.\nBefore adding a container to a node, push an image to your repository.\nReading and managing containers requires node-exec::read and node-exec::modify permissions, respectively. Executing a container requires node-exec::compute permission.\nManagement Navigate to Container Management under Compute on a node or cluster.\nHere you can add, enable, disable, delete, and import a container.\nField Name Description Name The name of the container. Execution Type A container can be deployed as one of three types.\nService - the container is created and will run as a daemon. If the node reboots, the container will start up automatically.\nRecurring - the container will run on a defined schedule. A schedule parameter is defined for the frequency, either as a rate or a cron expression.\nRate Description rate(30 minutes) Run every 30 minutes rate(1 hour) Run every hour rate(1 day) Run every day On Demand - typically used for testing. The container is executed for a single session, but will not restart on its own.\nStatus Only enabled containers will run. Image Name The name of the image to execute. Image Tag The image tag to execute. Overview Navigating into a container, the overview section allows editing basic information about the container’s execution environment.\nIn addition to the fields above, you can modify:\nField Name Description Command The command to execute inside the container. Hostname The hostname set inside the container. Stop Time The grace period (in seconds) to allow a container to stop before killing it. Defaults to 30 seconds. User Sets the username or group or uid or gid in the container. Save Output Persist standard output/standard error. Privileged Grant the container extended privileges. Use Init Use an init process inside the container as PID 1. This ensures responsibilities of an init system are performed inside the container (e.g., handling exit signals). Require Connectivity Ensures that the container will not start if it has encrypted volumes and is unable to reach the control plane. Environment Variables Environment variables can be added to a container to provide configuration information to the container at runtime.\nNetwork The networking section allows you to configure the container’s VRF, its port mappings, and its virtual networks and interfaces.\nHost Port Mappings Host port mappings allow you to expose a port on the host to the container. This is useful for exposing a service running in the container to the local network.\nField Name Description Protocol The protocol to listen for. If not specified, all traffic is forwarded to the container. Host Interface The host interface to listen on. Host Port The host port to listen on. Container Port The container port that will receive the mapped traffic. Virtual Networks Attaching a virtual network to a container allows virtual network traffic to reach it.\nField Name Description Virtual Network The virtual network to attach. Virtual IP The virtual IP to assign to the container. Allow Outbound Whether the container should be allowed to make outbound connections into the virtual network. Virtual Interfaces A virtual interface can be mapped to a container to forward all traffic.\nField Name Description Name The virtual interface name. Destination The interface destination inside the container. Mounts Mounts allow a container to persist data either as an externally defined volume, or a bind mount of the node’s filesystem.\nField Name Description Type Either BIND or VOLUME. For type VOLUME, the mount must reference an existing volume. Source For volumes, the name of the volume. For bind mounts, the path on the node’s filesystem. Destination The mount location inside the container. Resource Limits Containers can be restricted to limit the amount of resources they can consume from the host.\nField Name Description CPU Max % Maximum CPU allocation. Default is 50%. Memory Max (MB) Hard limit for RAM allocation. Default is 50% of the host’s memory. Memory High (MB) Soft limit for RAM allocation. Cannot exceed hard limit. Default is 45% of the host’s memory. IO Max Read (B/s) Max allowed bytes per second of IO reads. Disabled by default. IO Max Write (B/s) Max allowed bytes per second of IO writes. Disabled by default. IO Max Read Operations (ops/s) Max allowed IO read operations per second. Disabled by default. IO Max Write Operations (ops/s) Max allowed IO write operations per second. Disabled by default. Linux ulimits can be set for each container. Supported ulimits are:\nCORE DATA FSIZE LOCKS MEMLOCK MSGQUE NICE NOFILE NPROC RSS RTPRIO RTTIME SIGPENDING STACK Health Check A health check can be configured to monitor the container’s health. If the health check fails, the container will be restarted.\nField Name Description Command The command to run. A non-zero return code indicates a health check failure. Interval The frequency (in seconds) to run the health check. Timeout How long (in seconds) to wait for the health check to complete. A timeout is considered a failure. Start Period Grace period (in seconds) during container startup before health checks should start. Retries Number of allowed health check failures before marking the container unhealthy. Linux Capabilities Linux capabilities can be added to or removed from a container, allowing fine-grained control over kernel-level features and device access.\nLogging Configuration Log files (when persisting container output) are rotated based on a size threshold.\nField Name Description Max File Size (MB) The maximum size (in MB) of a log file before it is rotated. Max Files The maximum number of log files to keep.

As we began supporting additional services, such as Remote Access applications, more flexibility was needed.\nOpenID Support OpenID is a newer standard for managing communication between an application and an Identity Provider (IdP). It offers additional functionality compared to SAML including the ability to simplify integration.\nAt this point, Trustgrid supports simplified integration with Google G Suite and Microsoft AzureAD which includes the ability to synchronize groups and group members. Trustgrid will expand this functionality to other IdPs in the future but for now, other OpenID compatible IdPs can be integrated using a more generic OpenID setup process.\nSAML Self-Service Trustgrid will continue to support SAML integration. Previously the setup process required the Trustgrid Support Team to complete the configuration, but now this is available to Administrators.\nAdd Users Instead of Inviting Them Previously, adding new users to the Trustgrid portal was a bit clunky when using the SAML integration. To add a user you would:\nInvite the user. This would generate an email which the user didn’t really need.\nThe user would then need to successfully authenticate via the configured IdP.\nYou could then adjust the user’s role to reflect the appropriate permissions.\nNow, when an IdP is configured there is a simplified process:\nFrom the User Management panel click “Add User”\nFrom a single prompt, you can enter the user’s email address (matching what is configured in the Identify Provider), set their Role, and select the correct Identity Provider (if there is more than one).\nThe option to Invite Users is still available under Actions if you need to create users in the Trustgrid native IdP.\nDomain Improvements In addition to the changes outlined below, it is worth noting that Domains have been moved under the Management section of the navigation bar.\nReview Changes Trustgrid Domains encompass configuration settings that impact many nodes and clusters, such as Virtual Network Routes. The impacts of changes here can have a wide effect and it is not uncommon for multiple members of a team to be working in this context at the same time without knowing it.\nTo address this Trustgrid has updated the user interface to reduce the risk of improper or conflicting changes. After a change is made within a domain it is not immediately applied.\nInstead, a warning icon will be added to the Review Changes panel. Navigating to this panel will display all changes that are waiting to be applied.\nThe changes will include the user making the change. If more than one user has made changes they can confirm with that user if they are ready for that change to go into effect.\nOptionally, if they determine one of the changes should not be applied it can be removed by clicking the red X. Be aware that if this is done the change would have to be recreated and reviewed to add later.\nOnce the user has confirmed the changes look correct they can click Apply Changes. You will be prompted to confirm and then the changes will be pushed out to nodes in the domain.\nImproved Virtual Network Routes Table The Virtual Network Routes table has been significantly reworked in this release.\nThe biggest improvement is in the Destination selection method. The old interface required selecting from a long list of all nodes and clusters in the domains which became unmanageable as the number of these increased. Additionally, there was no distinguishing between nodes and clusters beyond the name.\nNow when the Destination field is selected you are given a list (typeahead filtered) that now has a prefix of Cluster or Node to clearly identify the destination type.\nAdditionally, the Save and Add Routes buttons have been moved to the top of the table to reduce the need to scroll down as you work.\nNo-NAT Virtual Networks Making Network Address Translation (NAT) easier to manage and scale has been a primary use case for Trustgrid. However, there are some situations where altering the IP addresses is unnecessary and even undesirable.\nTo address this we have added the ability to create a Virtual Network that will perform no address translation by default. This should greatly increase the ease of configuring such networks.\nWhen adding a new Virtual Network set the “No NAT Mode” to Yes. For a Network CIDR just enter 0.0.0.0/0, this field will be made optional in a later release.\nAfter creation, you will see that NO-NAT Mode is enabled in the table.\nWhenever this network is attached to a Node or Cluster interface you will see a notice like the below.\nVPN Improvements The VPN interface in the portal has been reworked in ways we hope will simplify the experience when configuring and managing.\nFeature Navigation Panels The legacy VPN page frequently required significant scrolling to get to the most relevant section. The new interface breaks these sections into multiple panels.\nSince Address Translation is the most commonly used section it is automatically selected when you navigate into the VPN context.\nImproved Multiple Virtual Network Support Trustgrid has supported Nodes and Clusters being attached to multiple Virtual Networks but the user experience interacting with them was cumbersome. For example, in a number of places, you had to select from a list of all the available virtual networks, even if they weren’t attached. This experience has been greatly improved.\nVPN Virtual Networks Table If the Node or Cluster is already attached to a single Virtual Network this will be selected automatically when you select the VPN navigation link. However, if you have multiple networks you will be presented with a table of only the attached Virtual Networks.\nThe Actions dropdown of this table will enable you to Attach additional Virtual Networks or Detach the current Virtual Networks.\nOverview Virtual Network Graph Previously the Overview Virtual Network graph listed all Virtual Networks within a domain. Now it will only show attached networks.\nVPN Toolbar Once you have navigated to the VPN context of a node and selected a Virtual Network you will see a bar like the below at the top of the page. The bar provides important data about the Virtual Network including the node’s Virtual Management IP (and the ability to edit it).\nClicking the Tools button on the right of the bar brings up a menu of both Virtual Network and Interface tools. Users no longer have to switch between tabs to access these different toolsets.\nNew Virtual Translation Table Interface The View Virtual Translation Table shows active NATs similar to a show connections command from legacy solutions. Previously running this tool produced raw console output that could be challenging to work with when there were large numbers of active connections.\nThe new version of the tools creates a paginated table that is easily searchable and can be refreshed without needing to return to the Tools section.\nProxyARP Option for Outside NATs Previously the Trustgrid node would ARP on the local network for any IP contained in the Local CIDR of an outside NAT. For example, if your Outside NAT Local CIDR was for 192.168.1.0/24, the node would respond to ARP requests for any IP in that network (192.168.1.1 - .254).\nThis is still the default behavior, but there is now an option to disable this functionality when configuring Outside NATs.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Improved Identity Provider Integration Trustgrid has supported SAML …","ref":"/docs/release-notes/cloud/archive/2021/march/","tags":"","title":"March"},{"body":"Data Plane Panel Improvements In the February 2022 release we introduced the Data Plane status panel for investigating connections between edge and gateway nodes. With this release we’ve added some tools to this panel. The new Ping and Test Performance tools are linked in the far right column of each gateway’s row.\nGateway Ping The gateway ping tool will launch a ping inside the data plane tunnel between the node and the gateway, similar to ICMP ping. This can provide a more realtime view of latency between node and gateway compared to the RTT column (only loaded on refresh) and the historical data which provides a minute by minute view.\nGateway Performance Tool The gateway performance tool attempts to estimate the available upload bandwidth between a node and gateway.\nBy default this tool will attempt to send 10MB of data to the destination device. This then used to calculate the available bandwidth. Sending more data provides a more accurate estimate but be aware that other devices using the same internet circuit may experience degraded performance while the test is running.\nThe periods are posted for about every 1MB of data sent. If you see exclamation marks this can indicate lost packets.\nTool Improvements MTR Improvements MTR, which was recently added to the portal, can be powerful troubleshooting tool, but it has many options which can be tricky for newer users. To simplify the use we’ve added a new user interface that provides graphical options for selecting common parameters.\nAWS Instances Metadata When the Trustgrid software is deployed in AWS we can gather additional metadata about the underlying instance. With this release we have added the availability zone, instances type and instance ID to the Info panel available on every node.\nTimestamps for Virtual Network Changes Before changes are committed to a virtual network setting, such as the virtual network route table, they are listed in the Changes panel for approval. This made it easier to see if other users had outstanding changes that might be in conflict. However, it wasn’t clear if the other user just made that change or if it had been left accidentally. With this release we’ve added a timestamp that shows when the user saved the change.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Data Plane Panel Improvements In the February 2022 release we …","ref":"/docs/release-notes/cloud/archive/2022/march/","tags":"","title":"March"},{"body":" A domain is the logical grouping of nodes inside an organization.\nDomains are a logical grouping of nodes, allowing configuration of virtual networks and node thresholds.

As Trustgrid has expanded our feature set, adding features like containers, and our user base have grown the predefined role structure has become a poor fit. Many times these new features required Trustgrid Support to grant access to users. Additionally, what each role could and could not do was opaque to customers.\nWith this release will be migrating to a policy-based approach that will allow customers to independently tailor permissions to meet their own use cases. Customers will also be able to see exactly what rights policies allow and what policy is granting a user access directly in the portal.\nThis migration will also allow future enhancements such as automatic policy assignment based on group membership, resource based policies limiting users to specific nodes/clusters, and more.\nHow it Works The new policy permission works as such:\nUsers can be attached to one or more policy Policies are defined that either allow or explicitly deny permissions or actions Permission are grouped according to the related feature/objects set Read allows a user to view that group of related objects Modify will allow users to add, change or delete those objects Additional actions such as running tools on a node can be allowed/denied A denied permission will override any allowed permission in another policy Migration of Role Permissions to Policies Trustgrid previously had 4 predefined roles. With this release these will be migrated into 5 new builtin policies, and an additional policy will be created. As part of this migration Trustgrid is also making sure these policies only include the “least-privileges” required to perform the intent of each of the previously defined roles.\nDuring the release process users previously assigned a role will be automatically assigned the corresponding policy or policies listed below\nBelow is a list of our historic roles and the policies that replace them plus any known changes. If users previously assigned a role lose a tool or function they need, they can either be attached to a higher level builtin policy with the appropriate permissions or a custom policy can be created and attached.\nMonitor (now tg-builtin-monitor policy) Changes:\nMonitor no longer has access to troubleshooting tools. These were removed because some of these seemed to exceed the privileges required for the user types expected to have this role. Operator (now tg-builtin-operator policy) No changes.\nNode-Administrator (now tg-builtin-node-admin policy) No changes.\nAdministrator (now tg-builtin-admin and tg-builtin-access-admin policy) The administrator role previously included both the ability to make almost all technical changes and the ability to control access and permission to the portal.\nTrustgrid determined that these functions are separate and many companies may want to further restrict the access administration to a subset of users. The functions have been split into two policies:\nbuiltin-tg-admin - Full access to make technical changes builtin-tg-access-admin - Ability to add or invite users, change and attach policies, and configure Identity Providers However, Trustgrid cannot determine who within an organization should and should not have each of these functions so during this migration any user that was previously assigned the Administrator role will be attached to both policies.\nIt is highly recommended customers review which users are attached to the builtin-tg-access-admin policy and remove from those that do not require it.\nProvisioning Order Improvements Contacts and Stakeholders Orders historically only had fields for a general order contact and a technical contact. With this release additional stakeholders can be listed (such as a project manager associated with the project or other executive contacts).\nThe goal is to eventually provide a method to send status updates to all contacts in a more automated fashion as order progress.\nAdd Provisioning Contacts for your Organization If you have stakeholders that will frequently be used on orders, you can add them as Contacts.\nThese will then be available to select in the stakeholders section of an order and will auto-polulate the fields\nActivity Report The new Activity Report will list all orders that transitioned to the selected Status during the selected Time Range and the results can be exported as a CSV. This can be useful for tracking progress of provisioning projects over time.\nRack Mount Field Added Some Trustgrid hardware has the option of including rack mounts. Previously this was documented in notes, but with this release a field has been added. If an appliance type does not have a rack mount option this will show as “unavailable”\nAccess to the Provisioning section of the portal is not a part of a builtin policy at this time. Access admins should create policies to grant users orders permissions and attach to the appropriate users.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Trustgrid Permissions Restructuring Trustgrid’s portal and API have …","ref":"/docs/release-notes/cloud/archive/2022/may/","tags":"","title":"May"},{"body":" Flow logs are a record of all traffic that passes through a node.

These volumes can even be encrypted using Trustgrid managed, software-based encryption.\nContainer Privileges It is now possible to run containers as a privileged user or specify the user/group the container should execute as. Additionally, you can add or drop Linux capabilities that the container has enabled on execution.\nImport Container Configuration Container configurations can end up complex. Recreating on many nodes is tedious and error prone. Trustgrid now supports importing the configuration from an existing node or cluster that has the container defined as desired.\nInteractive Tools Improvements Terminate Running Tools without Closing Window Interactive tools such as Terminal and Sniff Traffic now support terminating the session without closing the window. This can be useful in situations, such as if sniffing traffic on a very active node, where you want to be able to stop the tool but still be able to analyze the output.\nTraffic Capture Tool Improvements The Traffic Capture tool now displays the settings used while running.

This is usually desirable, but certain situations can require each member to have a different route defined. For example, If you have deployed your cluster members in different AWS Availability Zones for redundancy and you have the heartbeat communication on a LAN interface each would need a different route.\nWith this release you will see the ability to “Add Entry” for additional routes under the LAN interface section of cluster members. You will also see a read-only entry with a blue square for any cluster-defined route.\nData Plane Panel Improvements Easier Peer Selection Previously, to select a node in the data plane peers table you had to click exactly on the node’s name. Now, you can click anywhere in the name box.\nDisplay Data Plane Stats for Gateways Prior to this release we only displayed Tunnel Latency and Network Hops (when enabled) on edge node devices.

This data can be searched and refreshed. In a future release we will make historical RTT time viewable for each peer.\nFlow Log Improvements Flow logs provide valuable metadata about traffic across Trustgrid networks but our search had performance and reliability issues that made it difficult to use. With this release we’ve rearchitected how search these logs to allow for a significant performance improvement.\nImproved IP Geolocation Data Trustgrid has changed our public IP geolocation data providers to improve the accuracy of the information we use to place nodes on our Network Maps. This new provider will also allow us to present additional information such as ISP and ASN in the future, which could be handy for identifying when multiple devices from the same ISP or ASN start having issues.\nCustom Portal Roles Trustgrid is working on moving our permission structure beyond the four default roles (Monitor, Operator, Node-Administrator and Administrator) to allow customers to tailor roles to just the permissions their users need. For example, you could allow a user Monitor (read-only) permissions to most of the Trustgrid environment but grant them the ability to stop and start containers.\nCurrently this requires working with Trustgrid Support to define these new roles but once defined they can be assigned by Node Administrators and Administrators.\nOther Improvements You can now search the Nodes table for Management IPs and Device types Fixed a broken link in the new user invite email for customers without IDP integration ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Data Plane Status Table Previously Trustgrid had a visual indicator on …","ref":"/docs/release-notes/cloud/archive/2021/december/","tags":"","title":"December"},{"body":"Trustgrid uses each node’s public IP address to derive location information.

There are three main types of nodes - Edge, Gateway, and Management.\nAll Trustgrid nodes run on a hardened Ubuntu operating system. Nodes are managed through the Trustgrid portal or via the API (requires authentication token). A local UI exists to support the reconfiguration of an ethernet interface and diagnostic/network tests prior to connection to the Portal.\nEdge Nodes Edge Nodes build outgoing TLS tunnels to Gateway Nodes. Bidirectional traffic is supported through this tunnel, subject to ACLs and security policy restrictions. Edge Nodes will only require a firewall rule change if outbound internet restrictions are in place. Edge nodes can be a target for software deployment. Edge Nodes can be deployed with a single or multiple ethernet connections to support deployments behind a firewall or adjacent to a firewall (public WAN / private LAN).\nGateway Nodes Gateway Nodes accept incoming TLS tunnels from Edge Nodes. Traffic on these tunnels is bidirectional, as permitted by ACLs or policy. Gateway Nodes usually require a firewall change to permit the incoming traffic. Gateway Nodes are identical to Edge Nodes but with a gateway configuration applied. Gateway nodes only connect to other gateways if one is of type hub. Read more about gateway configuration.\nManagement Nodes Management Nodes are not like other nodes because they do not connect to the data plane, only the control plane. Management Nodes are deployed by Trustgrid for each customer and are multi-tenant like other control plane components. Customers may elect to deploy their own Management Nodes in place of multi-tenant Management Nodes. Management Nodes facilitate the monitoring, management, and support of Edge and Gateway Nodes.\nNode List View Adding a Tag as a Column on the Nodes Table Adding a tag as a column on the nodes tables is good way to make valuable information visible for multiple nodes at the same time.

Tags allow the user to identify quickly and easily a node or group of nodes with the same property. Both the name and value of the tags are set by the user. Names should provide the context and values provide the actual data. For example, to provide the address of a device you would set the name to address, and the value to something like 123 Main St.\nIt is a best practice for Trustgrid customers to standardize on a set of tag names and appropriate values. This increases the consistency of use across your organization. When adding tags the existing tag names and associated values will be prepopulated as options. Some common uses of tags are:\nSupporting information (production status, contact info, hours of operation, escalation) On-premise/edge location information (site name, address, pin code) Configuration (High availability, instance type, region, disaster recovery) Tag names and values are case-sensitive and should only consist of letters, numbers, dashes (-), and underscores (_).

In this configuration, the node can be used as the next hop for route destined for the virtual IP space, or the node can be used as the default gateway for a network. The virtual IP space is used as a transit network with NAT being utilized to translate IP addresses on to/from the virtual IP space on either side. It is also possible to preserve the original source and destination by having the virtual IP space be identical to the LAN network.\nThe Trustgrid VPN feature provides the capability to securely route IP packets between remote networks. In this configuration, Trustgrid nodes can operate as a distributed mesh virtual private network (VPN) that can allow applications to access remote data and services at layer 3 (L3) of the network OSI model. This is done by defining a virtual L3 network (similar to an Amazon VPC) and then selecting how local node networks are exposed and translated into the the virtual address space.\nAttaching a Network To use VPN functionality, a node or cluster must be attached to a domain virtual network.\nNavigate to the VPN section for your node or cluster, and select Actions-\u003eAttach.\nNetwork The network name (defined on the domain) to attach Network CIDR The network CIDR Validation CIDR The network route CIDR Virtual Management IP The virtual IP address to use in this network Once attached, navigate into the network to manage the VPN configuration.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Trustgrid nodes can be configured to provide VPN-like functionality, …","ref":"/docs/docs/nodes/vpn/","tags":"","title":"VPN"},{"body":"Overview VRFs can be used route / nat and filter what traffic is allowed to pass and how it should appear on the network. VRFs can be associated to an interface whether it be a physical interface / virtual network interface or other tunnel interfaces such as ipsec or gre. VRFs are segmented on a layer 3 level from all other traffic traversing the Trustgrid node.\nFor standard use cases of source nat and/or destination nat creating a route and a NAT is sufficient. Traffic rules can be used for more advanced controls. An applicable ACL is required for any traffic to pass as a zero trust methodology is applied.\nAddress Translation This is where NATs are created in order to translate the traffic to appear as desired on the network. NATs support translating both source and destination CIDRs as well as masquerading as the egress interface address.\nSNAT / DNAT Example Using the example NAT below if a source packet was initiated from 10.10.10.100 destined for 10.10.20.100 the source address would be translated to 192.168.10.100 and the destination address would be translated to 192.168.20.100. It is important to note that nat translations occur before routing decisions are made.\nMaquerade Example Using the example below if a source packet is initiated from within 10.10.10.0/24 destined for anything in 192.168.10.0/24 the source would be translated to the interface address the packet is egressing on. If it was a single interface Trustgrid node it would be sourced as the wan facing interface address.\nRoutes Note that NAT translations happen before routing so routes should be created for the destination NAT CIDR if applicable. Routes require a destination CIDR, interface and metric. A next hop is optional and only applicable for non-tunnel interfaces such as physical interfaces or vlan subinterfaces. The gateway of the applicable interface will be used if no next hop is defined.\nThe example below would be used for example to offload all internet bound traffic directly out the WAN facing interface\nTraffic Rules Traffic rules can be used for more advanced granular traffic manipulation beyond standard source and destination nat. There are many more parameters that can be applied to the traffic depending on the specific use case. When creating a traffic rule an ACL is required for traffic to pass. The available parameters are defined below. Rules are evaluated based on the line number. The first matching rule is the one that will be applied to the packet. More specific rules should always be implemented above less specific rules. Eg a rule for a /24 network should be above a /16 network the /24 is included in.\nField Name Description Number The line number the rule is applied to. Rules are matched in numerical order. Action All traffic rules have an action that is applied to the associated packet.\nAccept - The packet is allowed to be processed locally. Drop - The packet is dropped and not responded to Reject - A TCP Reset is sent in response Forward - The packet is forwarded to its defined destination such as an interface or another VRF Mirror - Packets are not manipulated but can be mirrored for inspection purposes. For example passing through an IDS container such as Snort. Log - The packet is not manipulated but is marked for logging Ingress Interface The traffic rule is applied to packets that ingress on this interface Forward Interface Packets are forwarded out this interface once the rule is applied Protcol The protocol that the rule should apply to. All, ICMP, TCP or UDP Forward VRF Packets are forwarded into another VRF that is associated on the node. Only configureable when a forward action is selected. Source CIDR The source network the rule should apply to Destination CIDR The destination network the rule should apply to Masquerade Translate and source all packets from the nodes interface address when enabled DNAT Destination Forward all traffic to the DNAT destination IP/Port. For example in order to forward all http traffic through a proxy Destination Mac The destination mac address defined overwrites the source mac address of the packet. Necessary only for some container deployments such as Snort inpsecting traffic. Ports Used to define a port range when creating a traffic rule Traffic Rule Example In the below example the first rule on line number 1 is forwarding all traffic destined to 10.0.20.0/24 to a virtual network tunnel interface. Any NATs configured under Address Translation will be applied before the packet is forwarded to its destination. The rule on line number 10 will forward all traffic that does not match the first rule out to the internet masquerading as the WAN interfaces address. If the line numbers were reversed the virtual network rule would never be matched as all traffic would match the internet offload rule which is configured for all source and destination traffic.\n","categories":["node"],"description":"","excerpt":"Overview VRFs can be used route / nat and filter what traffic is …","ref":"/docs/docs/nodes/vrfs/","tags":["vrfs","networking"],"title":"VRFs"},{"body":"Navigate to a node, then select ZTNA Gateway under the Network section.\nHTTPS Endpoint The HTTPS endpoint is used to provide connectivity for non-WireGuard ZTNA applications.\nField Name Description Enabled When enabled, this node will listen for ZTNA traffic.

Our robust networking feature set provides layer 3 and layer 4 network overlays with cloud management tools.\nTypes of Connectivity Trustgrid establishes mutual TLS tunnels between nodes using mutual authentication. These tunnels between edge nodes and gateway nodes constitute the data plane of a Trustgrid network. Over this tunnel two distinct types of connectivity are supported, Layer 3 and Layer 4. Layer 3 supports routed traffic and Network Address Translation (NAT) to replicate traditional WAN connections. Trustgrid’s Layer 4 networking uses reverse proxies to map local IP-port number combinations to remote hosts. Each connectivity type has distinct advantages and may be used for either gateway nodes or edge nodes.\nLayer 3 Overview The Trustgrid VPN feature provides the capability to securely route IP packets between networks. In this configuration, Trustgrid nodes can operate as a distributed mesh virtual private network (VPN) that can allow applications to access remote data and services at layer 3 (L3) of the network OSI model. This is done by defining a virtual L3 network (similar to an Amazon VPC) and then selecting how edge node networks are exposed and translated into the the virtual address space.\nLayer 3 configuration is required for all Trustgrid networking deployments on the Gateway (data center / cloud) side. This allows the use of L3 or Layer 4 configurations for edge node deployments. Layer 3 connectivity enables easy support of many hosts at each side of the connection. This allows the replication of existing routes and subnets to minimize reconfiguration of any remote or local networks.\nLayer 3 edge configuration is ideal in situations where there is an incomplete understanding of all traffic (source and destination hosts/ports) as it supports more permissive ACLs. It is required when using stateful protocols (except FTP) and other protocols such as SIP.\nAll gateway nodes must be deployed using L3 networking in a two interface (management/data NIC) configuration.\nLayer 4 Overview Trustgrid Layer 4 (L4) is only supported in edge configurations. Layer 4 networking enables a reverse proxy connection between the Gateway Node IP address:port number that maps directly to an on-premise host:port. Specific network plug-ins support stateful features like FTP using L4 connectivity. With Trustgrid’s L4 networks there is no concern of overlapping local IP subnets on either end of the tunnel because Trustgrid proxies the traffic. The source of all TCP/UDP traffic is the edge node interface, not the originating host. This is transparent to the hosts on either side.\nLayer 4 connectivity offers slightly better performance than L3 in specific types of traffic and is ideal when there is a single or few remote/edge hosts that are being accessed with deterministic traffic. Layer 4 edge nodes are usually easier to deploy at an edge site as they can avoid the configuration of a virtual network overlay (NATs, ACLs, Routes, etc). Remote sites that desire to view the actual source of traffic should use Layer 3 for edge configurations as the source IP for all traffic in a Layer 4 connection is the edge node’s data IP address.\n","categories":["overview"],"description":"Trustgrid networking overview\n","excerpt":"Trustgrid networking overview\n","ref":"/docs/getting-started/networking/","tags":["architecture"],"title":"Networking"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/categories/overview/","tags":"","title":"overview"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/tags/overview/","tags":"","title":"overview"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/tags/security/","tags":"","title":"security"},{"body":"Trustgrid support is available 24/7/365 with a commitment to respond to any Emergency Support request within 30 minutes.\nTo contact support: Email: support@trustgrid.io\nPhone: 888-308-8995 x2\nAuthorized Support Trustgrid can only provide support to customers with a Trustgrid Portal account commensurate with the account’s permission level in the portal.

Certificate based authentication is difficult and requires advanced skill sets. Trustgrid is the ‘root of trust’ in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) built by our security experts to enable automated certificate management across Trustgrid networks. All devices enroll in the PKI and are managed centrally from Trustgrid’s cloud infrastructure. Certificates are issued per device and are used to authenticate, and for encryption of all traffic.\nAuthorization Central to the security of the Trustgrid network is an authorization model derived from Google’s Beyond Corp (aka Zero Trust from Forrester) initiative. This places an implicit deny on all traffic that cannot be configured to allow all traffic. Many breaches have been caused by allowing all traffic to overcome the burden of proper security configuration.\nTrustgrid uses a token to authorize communication between Trustgrid nodes.\nTLS Encryption All data on Trustgrid is encrypted from node to node using next generation encryption – TLS Mutual Authentication. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) recommends TLS as the replacement to IPSec VPN.\nAutomated Management Trustgird offers tools for automating software updates at scale. A significant difficulty in securing traditional VPNs is the application of patches and updates to hardware appliances. Many vendors own and maintain hundreds or thousands of these devices and are simply unable to efficiently patch them. This leaves significant security vulnerabilities unaddressed in customer and vendor data centers.\nPrivate Data Routing Trustgrid enables private data connections routed on infrastructure owned by each vendor, not through centralized, multi-tenant gateways that touch hundreds of vendors’ connections concurrently.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Trustgrid’s mission is to replace aging Edge connectivity solutions …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/security/","tags":"","title":"Trustgrid Security"},{"body":" Changes to the following configurations are audited: API Cluster Node Domain Certificate Org Profile Invite Audits record the event type (add/remove/change), the user name, the IP address, and the date of the change Audits are kept for 30 days Audits can be downloaded as CSV on the operations page ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Changes to the following configurations are audited: API Cluster Node …","ref":"/docs/help-center/view-logs/config-changes/","tags":"","title":"View Configuration Changes"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/help-center/view-logs/","tags":"","title":"View Logs"},{"body":" View node update events on the Operations page Node update events are kept for 30 days You can download a CSV of the node updates from the Operations page All Trustgrid node agent updates and OS package updates are logged ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" View node update events on the Operations page Node update events are …","ref":"/docs/help-center/view-logs/node-update-events/","tags":"","title":"View Node Update Events"},{"body":" For every authentication event, we log: user agent user id user name IP address User authentication events include: Failed login attempts Successful login attempts API interactions Successful sign ups You can download all of the events for a 30 day period in the Operations page Authentication events are kept for 30 days If your organization is utilizing a third-party identity provider via SAML or OpenID, that provider is responsible for providing and storing authentication log records ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" For every authentication event, we log: user agent user id user name …","ref":"/docs/help-center/view-logs/user-authentication/","tags":"","title":"View User Authentication Events"},{"body":" An access policy is a list of rules that each allow, reject, or drop traffic at the VPN level.\nIf no rules are defined, traffic will not pass through the virtual network.\nA rule can match traffic based on the following fields:\nField Name Description Action Whether to ALLOW, DROP, or REJECT the traffic.

Description The description is displayed in the alarm filters table. Enabled An alarm filter must be enabled for matching event to be sent to the selected channel. Deselecting the check box can be handy if you wish to suppress a specific type of alarm. Channels This section determines which channels matching alarms will be sent to. Criteria The criteria determine which events will match the filter. These conditions can be set as:\nAll (default) - All specified criteria must be true to match. Equivalent to a boolean AND condition. Any - Only one criteria must be true to match. Equivalent to a boolean OR condition. None - The specified criteria must be false to match. Equivalent to a boolean NOT of the criteria ANDed together. Node Name The “Node Name” criteria llows you to select one or more specific node names. Note, even if the filter is set to All, the filter will match any of the selected node names is associated with the event. Event Type The “Event Type” criteria determines which events will match the filter. Note, even if the filter is set to All, the filter will match any of the selected event types. Tag Matches The “Tag Matches” criteria allows you to use tag name/value pairs to determine if the filter should match events. For examples, you may what production devices to send to a high priority channel such as PagerDuty or OpsGenie. If your nodes have a tag to indicating “prod_status=production”, you can select that name/value pair from the list to properly filter your alarms.\nSeverity Each event type has a severity level associated with it. This filter will match any event with the selected severity type or higher. This is the only mandatory criteria.\nThe severity levels are:\nINFO WARNING ERROR CRITICAL For example, if you select the severity level of WARNING the filter will match WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL events.\nSome events have a corresponding event that will automatically resolve the alert in the portal and in some channels such as PagerDuty. The corresponding event may have a different severity level, so make sure you select the lower severity for the criteria. e.g. Node Disconnect is a WARNING but Node Connect which resolves it is only INFO. So you’d need to select both Event Types and set the severity to INFO.\nContains Text This field will accept any single string of text to match to the contents of an event. For example, if all your gateways include -gw in the name you could enter that without quotes in the field and it would match any event that includes that text in the event payload. This criteria can also be used if there is another aspect of the node included in the event payload that doesn’t match the criteria above. To see the entire payload of an event configure a less specific payload and send to an email channel to see the JSON.\nThe event payload includes the node’s unique identifier (UID) which is a string of generated text and numbers. If your “Contains Text” criteria is too short, there is a chance a node UID will also match unexpectedly.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Alarm Filters are used to determine which events trigger …","ref":"/docs/docs/alarms/alarm-filters/","tags":["alarms","alarm filters"],"title":"Alarm Filters"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/tags/alarms/","tags":"","title":"alarms"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/tags/alert-suppression/","tags":"","title":"alert suppression"},{"body":" Maintenance and other planned disruptive activity can generate a large amount of alerts and notifications for no value.

Gateways can be deployed in the same availability zone or different ones to provide greater redundancy across AWS. Deploy a Trustgrid Node AMI in AWS.\nUnder networking \u003e clusters create a cluster using a descriptive and unique name as seen below. Select the cluster that was created and add both gateways to it using the actions drop down button as seen below. Configure the cluster heartbeat on each individual gateway node. This is located under system \u003e cluster. The host should be the gateway interface on which you want to configure the heartbeat. This can be either the WAN facing or LAN facing interface. You can see what IP is configured from the node page under interfaces. The port defaults to TCP 9000 but can be any unused TCP port if desired. Security groups for both gateways will need to allow this communication in both directions. Both gateways send a heartbeat to each other on the configured IP and Port to determine if the other member is healthy. If the secondary is not able to get a response from the primary then it will become the active member of the cluster. Once this has been configured both nodes should show as green and healthy in the cluster as seen below. If deploying gateways in different availability zones then LAN interface routes will need to be added to the cluster for both gateway LAN subnets as seen below. This is to ensure the heartbeat communication is routed over the correct interface instead of going out the WAN interface. Under the cluster \u003e interfaces \u003e eth1 LAN \u003e AWS Route Table Entries add the appropriate CIDR for the edge IP space. This should be the subnet that includes all virtual network IP space configured for edge node sites.

Once this has been added the route should be created in the routing table that is associated to the gateways LAN interface pointing to the ENI of the active member of the cluster.\nThere is an IAM profile that should have been associated to each gateway outlined in the deployment guide providing them permissions to manage the routes defined in the AWS Route Table Entries. When a failover event occurs an API Call is made to update the route to point to the ENI of the active member of the cluster.\nThis concludes the cluster configuration specifics for AWS deployment.

Deployment guide includes an …","ref":"/docs/tutorials/deployments/configure-ha-gateway-cluster-in-aws/","tags":["aws"],"title":"Configure HA Trustgrid Gateway Cluster in AWS"},{"body":"The VPN feature enables routing of IP packets by utilizing a virtual IP space that is configured on the nodes. In this configuration, the node can be used as the next hop for route destined for the virtual IP space, or the node can be used as the default gateway for a network. The virtual IP space is used as a transit network with NAT being utilized to translate IP addresses on to/from the virtual IP space on either side. It is also possible to preserve the original source and destination by having the virtual IP space be identical to the LAN network.\nThe Trustgrid VPN feature provides the capability to securely route IP packets between remote networks. In this configuration, Trustgrid nodes can operate as a distributed mesh virtual private network (VPN) that can allow applications to access remote data and services at layer 3 (L3) of the network OSI model. This is done by defining a virtual L3 network (similar to an Amazon VPC) and then selecting how local node networks are exposed and translated into the the virtual address space.\nThe following steps illustrate how to configure the Trustgrid VPN feature and will need to be configured on all nodes/clusters that need to communicate across the virtual network.\nCreate the Virtual Network Under Domains -\u003e Domain -\u003e Virtual Networks create the Virtual Network. All gateway/edge nodes deployed and attached to this virtual network will need to be assigned a subnet out of this IP space. It is important to ensure the CIDR created is large enough to encompass all future node deployments. In this example the entire IPV4 space is being used. This IP space is only applicable to the individual virtual network therefore if there are multiple virtual networks there is no overlap or conflict in IP space allocation. Create Routes for the desired Virtual CIDR with the destination being either a single node or a cluster if an HA deployment. Create the appropriate ACL’s if desired for only allowing specific traffic to pass. An ACL is required for any traffic to pass as it is a zero trust model. If traffic is already filtered before reaching the Trustgrid nodes then at minimum an Any:Any rule will need to be created as seen below. Attach Virtual Network to Node / Cluster Select the node or cluster and under vpn attach the virtual network. Define the validation CIDR which should match the route created. NAT rules can only be created within this CIDR. Select the appropriate interface to attach the virtual network to. This can be a physical interface or a virtual vlan interface and should be whichever interface clients will be using as the next hop to reach the remote networks. Configure the appropriate Inside and Outside NATs and then save the configuration. NATs explained in further detail below. Inside NAT: An inside NAT defines how a local device IP address translates into a virtual network address. For instance, a local device may have a local IP address of 192.168.1.100, but you may want it to appear to other devices or applications on the virtual network as IP address 10.0.20.100. Or you may want an entire block of local IP addresses to show up on the virtual network as a different block. You can do this translation via Inside NATs. Inside NAT’s also control what local devices can participate on the virtual network. If a local device does not have an inside NAT configured that includes its IP address, it can’t access or be accessed by other devices on the network. To add an inside NAT you must enter the following information:\nLocal CIDR - The local IP address or address block that should be mapped into the virtual network. It should be entered in CIDR block format (eg - 192.168.100.0/24 or 192.168.100.51/32).\nVirtual CIDR - The network IP address or addresses that the local IP addresses should be mapped to, also entered in CIDR block format.\nNote that network addresses map 1x1 with local addresses, so the prefix length (the /xx number of the CIDR) should be the same in both the local and network CIDR blocks of the inside NAT entry.\nOutside NAT: By default, when a device on the local network of a node receives traffic from a remote device on the network, the remote device IP address will be the IP address that was entered in the local CIDR block for the remote node’s inside NAT entry for the remote device. For instance, if the remote device was mapped to network address 10.0.100.1, then its traffic on the local network will appear to come from IP address 10.0.100.1. However due to the local network configuration, there may be some situations where it is desirable to translate remote network addresses before egressing onto the local network. For instance on a local network of 192.168.0.0/16, a user may want the remote devices virtual network IP of 10.0.100.1 to be translated to 192.168.50.5 so that it fits better into the local network setup. This kind of translation can be achieved by adding outside nats. To add an outside NAT you must enter the following information:\nNetwork Group - The network IP address or addresses that should be translated before egressing onto the local network. This should be entered in CIDR block format.\nLocal CIDR - The local IP address or addresses that the network addresses should be mapped to, also entered in CIDR format.\nNote there are situations where it may be desirable to make multiple remote devices masquerade as one local IP address though the use of port address translation (PAT). This can be achieved by defining an outside nat in which the network CIDR contains a larger address space than the local CIDR. For instance, an entry with network CIDR 10.0.1.0/24 and local CIDR 192.168.100.10 would make all remote devices with network IP addresses in 10.0.1.0/24 appear as IP address 192.168.100.10 on the local network.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The VPN feature enables routing of IP packets by utilizing a virtual …","ref":"/docs/tutorials/config-l3-vpn/","tags":"","title":"Configure Layer 3 VPN"},{"body":"This describes the process of deploying a WireGuard client which will act as a Trustgrid Edge node connecting to a Trustgrid gateway routing traffic for clients connecting via the WireGuard service.

The easiest scenario to deploy is a Layer 4, behind the firewall, single node deployment. This is the standard recommendation. When deployed behind a firewall, the firewall must allow egress traffic to Trustgrid’s Cloud environment (see Network Requirements) and the network(s) where the gateway nodes are installed.\nBeside a Firewall In some scenarios, you may want to deploy your Trustgrid node(s) beside the firewall. In this configuration, the management interface of each node will be connected directly to the internet and the data interface will get connected to a LAN such as the inside/LAN network.\nEdge Network Topology: Considerations in this Configuration: A unique, static, public IP address is required for each node. Typical deployments beside a firewall involve a switch connected to the ISP’s ethernet handoff, the firewall, and the nodes. Clustered nodes in this configuration may require using the data interface for cluster communication. It is possible to configure L4 proxy connectors that are bound to the management interface. Care should be taken to ensure that L4 proxy connectors aren’t inadvertently configured to allow access to a service from the public internet. If using L4 proxy connectors on the management interface, the source CIDR should be used to limit access to the service as desired. Requirements to Configure: Standard 1 Public IP Address 1 Private IP Address 2 DNS Servers HA 2 Public IP Addresses 2 Private IP Addresses 1 Private IP Address for Cluster IP 2 DNS Servers Behind a Firewall The most typical configuration for edge nodes is to place the nodes behind a firewall with the appropriate access controls in place to allow communication on the management interface. In this configuration, the management configuration can be placed in a DMZ network and the data interface would get connected to a LAN such as the inside/LAN network.\nEdge Network Topology: Considerations in this Configuration: Multiple nodes can NAT to a single public IP address. Firewalls in front of gateway nodes must be configured to allow access to the IP:Port of the gateway nodes from the public IP address(es) that the node(s) NAT to. The firewall must be configured to allow outbound traffic from the management interface of the node(s) based on Trustgrid’s network requirements. Requirements to Configure: Standard 1 Public IP Address 1 Private IP Address 2 DNS Servers HA 2 Public IP Addresses 2 Private IP Addresses 1 Private IP Address for Cluster IP 2 DNS Servers Firewalled Nodes Some organizations may choose to put the management interface behind a firewall and also put a firewall between the data interface and the local network.\nEdge Network Topology: Considerations in this Configuration: Multiple nodes can NAT to a single public IP address. Firewalls in front of gateway nodes must be configured to allow access to the IP:Port of the gateway nodes from the public IP address(es) that the node(s) NAT to. The firewall between the node(s) and the internet must be configured to allow outbound traffic from the management interface of the node(s) based on Trustgrid’s network requirements. The firewall between the node(s) and the LAN must allow connectivity from all IP addresses associated with the node(s) data interface to resources on the necessary services on the LAN. This includes any IP addresses used in outside NAT configurations as well as the cluster IP. Requirements to Configure: Standard 1 Public IP Address 1 Private IP Address 2 DNS Servers HA 2 Public IP Addresses 2 Private IP Addresses 1 Private IP Address for Cluster IP 2 DNS Servers On-a-stick - Single Node Interface Our best practice recommendation is to separate the management and data traffic when possible, but in some cases the use of both network interfaces on edge nodes isn’t desirable. The most common scenario for this configuration is when the edge network is a small, basic, network where utilizing both interfaces on the node(s) would mean connecting both interfaces to the same network. In this scenario, an on-a-stick configuration can be used.\nEdge Network Topology: Considerations in this Configuration: Only the management interface of the node is used, requiring a minimum of three IP addresses to support both management/data traffic. The management interface must be connected to a network that allows outbound access to the internet based on our network documentation, as well as access to a LAN/inside network. Clustered nodes should be configured with the cluster communication IP set to the IP of the management interface. Requirements to Configure: Standard 1 Private IP Address 2 DNS Servers HA 2 Private IP Addresses 1 Private IP Address for Cluster IP 2 DNS Servers Hosted FI Core - Access to Remote Network via Edge A common deployment scenario involves the need to access a network that is routable from the edge location, but outside of the network that the Trustgrid edge node is configured on. An example of this is a financial institution with a hosted core that may be available from the financial institution over a connection such as a VPN or MPLS.\nEdge Network Topology: Considerations in this Configuration: Inside NAT(s) for the remote address should be added on the data interface to map the hosted core IP address(es) to virtual IPs on the Trustgrid virtual network. In this scenario setting a route on the data interface from the Trustgrid portal may be necessary. In most cases the hosted core provider will need to allow access to the hosted core from any IP addresses associated with a node’s data interface. This includes any IP addresses used in outside NAT configurations as well as the cluster IP. Outside NAT - Avoiding Routing at the Edge In some scenarios, it may not be desirable to have to add routes on the edge network in order to route traffic through the Trustgrid network. We recommend using L4 proxy in these scenarios when possible, however outside NAT can be utilized to allow traffic to and from the edge network without adding routes on the edge network.\nEdge Network Topology: Considerations in this Configuration: In this configuration you can configure PAT, which allows you to source all traffic from the node on a single IP address that exists on the local network. The IP address that you select must be a free IP address on the network that is also excluded from any DHCP scope on the subnet that it’s in. In some cases it may be desirable to use multiple outside NATs in order to identify traffic from a gateway-side host using a unique source IP at the edge. Using more than a handful of outside NATs is not recommended as it may present a problem with connectivity during a HA failover situation. L3 to L4 Proxying - Function with 1 IP In deployments where only a few services need to be accessed via an edge node, it may make sense to deploy the edge node in a mode in which the edge node intercepts layer 3 TCP traffic and proxies the traffic to a TCP service defined in the L4 Proxy configuration. The advantage of configuring the edge node in this fashion is that the traffic effectively does a source pat out of the node interface IP address, thus simplifying the network configuration at the edge node location. The edge node appears to the server as a single client machine accessing the server, rather than a range of different IP clients for which the network in that location must be configured to forward traffic to. One of the biggest differences between this and the previous outside nat configuration is that all traffic is coming from the single interface IP address, rather than a separate IP address.\nConsiderations in this Configuration: In this configuration all traffic for a configured service will come from a single IP address. If you need to differentiate different clients by IP address, this configuration will not suffice. Only TCP services can be used in this configuration. UDP and ICMP will not be usable with this configuration.

The platform is designed to simplify networking for distributed enterprises by providing a software-defined network (SDN) that operates as a virtual overlay on top of existing networks, enabling organizations to build and manage their own private networks.\nNodes The basic building block of a Trustgrid network is a node. Nodes are deployed on-premises or in your cloud provider and are connected to each other with TLS tunnels. Nodes can be deployed in a variety of ways, including as virtual machines, containers, or bare metal servers.\nNodes are used to enable connectivity and access for different use cases, including:\nZTNA applications, allowing fine-grained network control for access to business applications or servers VPN-like functionality, allowing network address translation (NAT) and routing between nodes Remote container execution, allowing an admin to deploy and manage containers in edge networks FTP (remote or in a data center) and other layer 4 protocols Clusters Nodes can be grouped into clusters to share configuration and provide high-availability.\nVirtual Networks Nodes can be attached to virtual networks, which provide a way to share network configuration like routes, NATs, and ACLs at scale.\nApplications Applications can be exposed through nodes or clusters. Access to an application can be restricted via access policies, for example to only allow users from a specific country.\nManagement All Trustgrid nodes are entirely managed through our control plane:\nSoftware updates are provided through our apt repository that ensures nodes have security updates available and only run with tested software permutations Network, node, user, and application configuration is managed through our web portal Configuration changes are broadcast to nodes as needed, for example when adding routes or adding a gateway to your network Next Steps The first step to try out Trustgrid is create an account.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Concepts Trustgrid is a platform that provides secure, reliable and …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/","tags":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"body":" Trustgrid supports configuring GRE tunnels that can be used to establish connectivity to any appliance that supports the GRE protocol.

How it Works The node will send out packets to each peer’s public IP and port (if a gateway) with incrementing Time To Live (TTL) values. As the packets pass through each router (or hop) along the way the TTL is decreased by one. Any time a router receives a packet with at TTL with the value 1 it will drop the packet and can reply with an ICMP packet saying “Time to Live has been exceeded” The node uses these ICMP packets to calculate latency to each hop. Known Limitations There are several known limitations with gathering this data:\nRouters on the internet are not required to respond with ICMP. This will lead to gaps in the Hop numbers. Those that do respond sometimes deprioritize their response which leads to misleading latency numbers. If you see a hop with high values, but the the values for higher hop numbers is normal this is not likely the cause of problems If a hop has high values and all subsequent hops have higher values this is likely the source of the latency/loss Firewall rules have to allow the packets and the responses. By utilizing the same TCP port as the gateway, all data collected from edge nodes should be allowed out. Some firewalls/routers have trouble correlating the TCP request with the ICMP response which leads to no data Gathering this data requires compute resources on the node and the gateway. Trustgrid recommends only enabling on edge nodes that have frequent latency or packet loss issues as a troubleshooting tool. It is not recommended to enable this feature on public gateways or private gateways with a large number of clients Enabling Network Hop Monitoring Navigate to the node you want to enable Verify there version is 20220808 or higher Navigate to Gateway under the System section Enable Network Hop Monitoring and click Save Special Considerations Azure Nodes If you enable this on an edge node running on an Azure VM, the default security group rules will prevent responses from intermediate hops on the path.

Add an interface from the Actions menu.\nInside NATs An inside NAT defines how a local device IP address translates into a virtual network address. For instance, a local device may have a local IP address of 192.168.1.100, but you may want it to appear to other devices or applications on the virtual network as IP address 10.0.20.100. Or you may want an entire block of local IP addresses to show up on the virtual network as a different block. You can do this translation via Inside NATs. Inside NAT’s also control what local devices can participate on the virtual network. If a local device does not have an inside NAT configured that includes its IP address, it can’t access or be accessed by other devices on the network. Inside NATs require the following information:\nLocal CIDR The local IP address or address block that should be mapped into the virtual network. It should be entered in CIDR block format (eg - 192.168.100.0/24 or 192.168.100.51/32). Virtual CIDR The network IP address or addresses that the local IP addresses should be mapped to, also entered in CIDR block format. Network addresses map 1x1 with local addresses, so the prefix length (the /xx number of the CIDR) should be the same in both the local and network CIDR blocks of the inside NAT entry. Outside NATs By default, when a device on the local network of a node receives traffic from a remote device on the network, the remote device IP address will be the IP address that was entered in the local CIDR block for the remote node’s inside NAT entry for the remote device. For instance, if the remote device was mapped to network address 10.0.100.1, then its traffic on the local network will appear to come from IP address 10.0.100.1. However due to the local network configuration, there may be some situations where it is desirable to translate remote network addresses before egressing onto the local network. For instance on a local network of 192.168.0.0/16, a user may want the remote devices virtual network IP of 10.0.100.1 to be translated to 192.168.50.5 so that it fits better into the local network setup. This kind of translation can be achieved by adding outside nats. To add an outside NAT you must enter the following information:\nNetwork Group The network IP address or addresses that should be translated before egressing onto the local network. This should be entered in CIDR block format. Local CIDR The local IP address or addresses that the network addresses should be mapped to, also entered in CIDR format. An outside NAT is required for all nodes and clusters using the virtual network Note there are situations where it may be desirable to make multiple remote devices masquerade as one local IP address though the use of port address translation (PAT). This can be achieved by defining an outside nat in which the network CIDR contains a larger address space than the local CIDR. For instance, an entry with network CIDR 10.0.1.0/24 and local CIDR 192.168.100.10 would make all remote devices with network IP addresses in 10.0.1.0/24 appear as IP address 192.168.100.10 on the local network.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" NATs allow Trustgrid to alter the source and/or destination IP …","ref":"/docs/docs/nodes/vpn/nats/","tags":"","title":"NATs"},{"body":" A network group is a list of network objects that allows for easier rule management.\nA network group requires a name to be set.

Determine Connectivity Status of the Trustgrid Node Because Trustgrid provides independent control and data planes, there are a few ways it can manifest as “down”:\nControl Plane Down The node appears offline from within the Trustgrid portal. This indicates that the node shutdown or has not sent a heartbeat notification to Trustgrid within the past 10 minutes. Data Plane Down The node appears online from within the portal but reports it is unable to connect to one or more gateway nodes. This can be indicated by the Data Plane Status indicator when viewing the node in the portal, or by receiving a “Gateway Connectivity Health Check” failure event notification. Both of these only work if the Control Plane is currently working. Both Control and Data Plane Down In this situation the node appears down in the Trustgrid Portal and users/applications are unable to reach services across the data plane between the Gateway and Edge sites. This is the most common scenario. While the Data Plane is most critical for the services provided across the device, first priority should be restoring the Control Plane connection so that additional troubleshooting tools are available. Often this process also uncovers the reason the data plane is down.

When something is not configured correctly, the trustgrid node responds to an ICMP ping with a variety of different “Destination Unreachable” error messages that can indicate what exactly appears to be wrong. Here are the error responses the node may give when attempting to ping a remote machine through the VPN when something is amiss.\nDestination Net Unknown This error means that the node cannot find an interface network binding with an inside and outside nat that match the requests source and destination IP. You should re-examine the inside and outside nats for the node interface that is receiving the packet, and make sure that an inside nat is defined that matches the source machines local IP and an outside nat that matches the virtual destination IP (or that no outside nat is present, which defaults to 1x1).\nDestination Net Unreachable This error means that the node cannot find a route defined at the domain/network level for the destination IP in this request. You should examine the domain route definitions and make sure that one is included for the virtual destination IP address you are trying to ping. Use the View Virtual Route Table tool using the target IP as a filter to confirm the route exists and is available.\nDestination Host Unreachable This error indicates that there is a route defined for the ping dest IP, but that the destination node associated with the route is not currently connected to this node. You should look at the routes in the source node’s detail page in the portal and make sure that there is one included for the destination node that should be receiving the request.\nPacket Filtered This error results when the ping request could not be performed do to the lack of a domain network ACL allowing the request. While this itself only indicates that ICMP traffic is not allowed between these two hosts in this direction, it can be used as a valuable indicator of a bigger policy issue. Check your ACL list in the portal to ensure that icmp are allowed between these to hosts.\nDestination Host Unknown This error happens when the ping packet made it to the destination node, but no set of inside/outside nats could be found that include the source and destination IPs of this request. Check the destination node VPN settings to ensure an inside NAT is present for the virtual destination IP of the request, and either an outside NAT exists and includes the virtual source IP, or no outside NAT is present, which defaults to 1x1.\nNo Ping Response Error When a ping sits there and no response is received, usually the best way to troubleshoot further is to sniff interface traffic with a filter of icmp and host \u003ctarget-ip\u003e on the source and dest nodes.\nWhen troubleshooting, keep in mind that the lack of an error likely means one of the following:\nThe local node VPN interface that should be receiving the packet hasn’t been configured correctly. The local firewall, router or target machine isn’t correctly routing packets to the source node. There is an ARP issue on either the source or destination node where the node isn’t responding correctly (tcpdump -i \u003cdata_nic\u003e arp) There is no responding machine on the remote side!

Policies either allow or explicitly deny specific actions by the user.\nTypes of Policies Trustgrid Managed Policies These policies start with the prefix builtin-tg and are created and managed by Trustgrid to provide a starting level of permissions based on common user types. Descriptions of the user types for each role are listed below.\nAs Trustgrid adds new features or actions theses policies will automatically be updated to include appropriate permissions. These policies cannot be edited by customers.\nCustomer Managed Policies These policies can be defined by customers to meet the specific needs of their teams.\nBest Practices Start by attaching the Trustgrid Managed Policies that best fits the user’s minimum, required needs following the principle of “least privilege.” If additional permissions are required, create a Customer Managed Policy that includes those specific rights rights. Then attach that policy to the user. Trustgrid Managed Policy Descriptions Below are the basic descriptions of the Trustgrid Managed Policies including an example role description. Trustgrid will use this description to guide if it is appropriate to add new permissions to the policies.\nThe policies are listed from lowest permissions to highest.\ntg-builtin-apps-user This policy provides minimal permission for a user to connect to the Trustgrid applications portal for using Remote access apps. The user has no rights within the Trustgrid management portal and should likely be given a landing page of /apps to be redirected straight to the applications portal.\nTarget User: End user for remote access applications with no knowledge of the Trustgrid system.\ntg-builtin-monitor This policy provides read-only access to non-sensitive resources in the Trustgrid management portal.\nTarget User: Project manager or executive sponsor that needs to view information in the portal, but does not require tools required to troubleshoot or resolve issues.\ntg-builtin-operator This policy provides mostly read-only access but also has the ability to view and use tools within the portal and perform actions to resolve common issues (e.g. restarting/rebooting nodes).\nTarget User: Entry level technical resources responsible for initial triage of support issues.\ntg-builtin-node-admin This policy provides the ability to make changes to most resources but is restricted from making changes that can have a wide impact such as changing a gateway node server settings.\nTarget User: Mid-level technical resources that need to make changes to things like node VPN configuration and virtual networks routes, but should be restricted from making changes that can impact an entire organization when possible.\ntg-builtin-admin This policy has permissions to change almost all resources with the exceptions of Identity Providers and User Management.\nTarget User: Senior technical resources needing near full access.\ntg-builtin-access-admin This policy grants the ability to manage permissions and identity related resources including configuring Identity Providers, Add/Inviting Users, and creating and assigning policies\nTarget User: Management or access control related resources responsible for granting access to the Trustgrid system.\nResource-Scoped Policies Policies have a Resources section that allow the permissions granted to be limited to specific Trustgrid resources, such as nodes and clusters. This can be used to present a user with an extremely limited view in the portal. For example, an edge site technical contact could be given a login that was only permitted to see the nodes at their site.\nTrustgrid Resource Names or TGRN Trustgrid has adopted a resource naming convention that follows the basic format: tgrn:tg::\u003cservice\u003e:\u003cresource-type\u003e/\u003cresource-id\u003e\nWildcard TGRN By default the Resources field is populated with * which grants permissions to all resources. This is included by default for new policies and would need to be removed to provide TGRN restricted permissions.\nNode TGRN A node’s TGRN will start with the below prefix: tgrn:tg::nodes:node/ To get the node’s complete TGRN you’ll need to append the node ID which is visible by navigating to the node and either copying from the URL or using the Node ID field in the Info visor drop down\nA complete node TGRN looks like: tgrn:tg::nodes:node/ab3550cf-f3da-4d90-b4b1-b870fc85c9c7\nCluster TGRN Cluster TGRN start with the prefix: tgrn:tg::nodes:cluster/ This is followed by the cluster’s fully qualified domain name (fqdn) which is the combination of the cluster name and your organizations trustgrid domain. This visible in the URL when you navigate to a cluster in the portal.\nA complete cluster TGRN looks like: tgrn:tg::nodes:cluster/awscluster.training.trustgrid.io\nPolicy Management Creating/Editing Policies Navigate to User Management → Policies For a new policy click Create Policy. To edit an existing find it in the list and click on its name. The policy wizard has two sections. The left section groups permissions by category and is where you allow or deny permissions. The right section shows the resulting JSON of the policy and is read only. As an example we will create a role to grant users the ability to see, edit and comment on Provisioning orders. a. Under Permissions, search for orders b. Click the green check box next to each of the desired permissions. (Clicking the X would explicitly deny that permission which will take precedent over any other policy that allows that permission) c. You will notice the Policy JSON updated as you select permissions d.

Click the link to the desired domain under the “Name” column. Scroll down to the “Virtual Networks” section and select the Routes tab. A Route has Three Required Fields:\nField Name Description Destination This will be the name of the node or cluster that traffic will be routed to. This list is auto-populated based on the nodes and clusters in the selected domain. Destination CIDR This is the CIDR notation of the virtual network that should be routed to the above destination node or cluster. Metric If there are multiple routes for the same virtual network the metric will determine which route will be used. The lowest number is the highest priority. See the “Automatic Failover” text below. Route Failover Route failover allows a subnet to be routed to an alternate node or cluster in the event of a failure. This can be automatic or performed manually.\nPrerequisites In either configuration, the virtual network settings under VPN settings for the primary and backup destination nodes/clusters must match. Including:\nNetwork Virtual Route\nNetwork Group under Outside NAT Table\nVirtual CIDR under Inside NAT Table\nAutomatic Failover To have the route failover without manual intervention you must define two routes for the same subnet (Destination CIDR) with different metrics. The lowest numerical metric will take precedence unless the destination node or cluster is offline.\nIn the below example configuration we want traffic for the 10.20.0.0/24 network to the edge cluster first, and failover to the edge-dr cluster.\nPreventing Automated Failback or Forcing a Failover As mentioned above if multiple routes are configured traffic will route to destination with the lowest metric number. So if the primary destination fails but then comes back online traffic will be routed back automatically.\nHowever, there are some circumstances where this is not desirable. For example, if the primary site is unstable you may wish to keep traffic at the backup site until the primary is stabilized. Alternately, you may wish to preemptively reroute traffic to the backup site in advance of planned maintenance at the primary site.\nTo preemptively reroute traffic to the backup site, update the backup route to have a lower metric than the primary route.\nManual Failover In some circumstances, it may be preferable for failover to only occur with manual intervention. In this situation, you will have a single route under the domain. To initiate a failover you’ll need to update the destination cluster/node.\nLogin to the Portal and select your domain. Click the link to the desired domain under the “Name” column. Scroll down to the “Virtual Networks” section and select the “Routes” tab. Find the route you wish to failover. Update the destination device. (e.g. in the below you would switch from edge to edge-dr). Click save.

This is handled by the Virtual Network Route Table.\nIn the examples below, xxxEdgeCluster is the primary site and xxx-edge3 is the secondary/disaster recovery site. Manual Failover When a customer has selected manual failover, a portal user will need to adjust the destination of all routes currently pointed at the failed site.\nFailing Over There will usually be routes for the nodes’ Virtual Management IP. These should not be changed in this process.\nIn the portal, navigate to Domain → Virtual Networks and then select the appropriate Virtual network.\nSelect the Routes panel from the left navigation bar.\nFilter the route table either using the node/cluster names or network to be failed over (shown below).\na.

Once that has completed any new flow or connection will automatically be sent to the new destination node. If the node/cluster is still online at the primary site, and there are existing flows/connections they will persist at that site. To clear them restart the active node at the primary site. See the last step in the Forcing Failover section below for instructions. Failing Back To send traffic back to the primary site reverse the changes in the routing performed during the failover.\nAutomatic Failover When a customer has selected automatic failover between sites there should be no intervention required if the primary site goes offline.

For example, intermittent issues may require leaving a capture running for an unknown period of time. Or, perhaps you need to review the application data within the packet payload.\nThe Traffic Capture is started with a standard tcpdump filter, just like the sniff interface tool, and max capture file size. Once the capture is stopped the captured data is written to .pcap files which can then be transferred for review.\nThe pcap files will include the data payload of any communication captured. If a non-encrypted protocol (such as HTTP or FTP) is used this could be visible in clear text. Because of the risk of data being visible, there are several restrictions and controls in place:\nThe permission to run this tool (node-advanced::service:tg-capture) must be granted on a per-user basis. Not even administrators have this feature by default. Trustgrid employees are specifically denied the ability to run this tool. Trustgrid employees are not permitted to view data transferred through our devices, so please do not send us the resulting pcap files. Accessing \u0026 Using Sniff Interface Traffic Login to the Trustgrid portal and navigate to the Node from which you want to capture traffic.\nSelect Interfaces under the Network section.\nClick the Sniff Traffic button\nSet the appropriate parameters.\niface The interface name filter The tool utilizes TCPDump filtering syntax, which can help isolate interesting traffic. The below filter would show only ICMP and TCP traffic Click Execute to view the captured traffic\nTransfer PCAP Files Now that you have created the pcap files you will need to transfer them somewhere for analysis. The Trustgrid node has standard file transfer clients installed including scp, sftp, and ftp.\nOn a Local Network If the destination file server is on the local network of the node you will use the standard Terminal tool to run the file transfer commands.\nNavigate to the node Open a terminal from the toolbar at the top right You will need to ensure that:\nThe node has a valid route to the destination server’s network Any firewall between the node and destination server allows the traffic The destination server is configured to allow the node IP to connect Once you are in the terminal with the above configured an example scp command would look something like scp ~/captures/capture-2021-07-16_17-59-23.pcap0 username@172.16.100.10:/captures/capture-2021-07-16_17-59-23.pcap.\nAcross the Virtual Network If the destination file server is across a Trustgrid virtual network you will need to use the VPN Admin terminal to run the file transfer commands. This uses the nodes configured Virtual Management IP to communicate to remote resources.\nNavigate to the node\nSelect the VPN panel. You may need to select the virtual network to use, if your device is connected to multiple.\nSelect the Admin Terminal button from the tools dropdown.\nYou will need to ensure that:\nThe node has a virtual management IP assigned. The tool will not launch without this. A route for the virtual management IP exists in the virtual network route table. On the destination node, that a 1:1 NAT exists for the destination file server assigning it to a virtual IP. A route that includes the destination file server’s VIP exists in the network route table. A virtual network access policy exists that allows the source node’s virtual management IP to connect to the destination file server’s VIP on the required port for your protocol. The destination side node has a valid route to the destination server’s network. Any firewall between the node and destination server allows the traffic. The destination is configured to allow the node IP to connect. Once you are in the admin terminal with the above configured, an example SCP command would look like scp ~/captures/capture-2021-07-16_17-59-23.pcap0 username@10.200.100.10:/captures/capture-2021-07-16_17-59-23.pcap.\nUseful Filters The below filters can be combined using “and” \u0026 “or” without quotes\nYou can filter based on protocol such as “tcp”, “udp”, or “icmp” without quotes Best practice is to filter for what you want to see rather than filter out what you don’t want to see To see only traffic for a specific host use “host x.x.x.x” with the IP address in place of the x.x.x.x To see only traffic for a specific port use “port XXXX” replacing the XXXX with the desired port number If capturing traffic on a clustered node, you should filter out the cluster port traffic. Typically port 9000 or 1975. E.g., not port 9000 If capturing on the ETH0 - WAN Interface, you should filter out traffic to both Trustgrid’s network (35.171.100.16/28) and your data plane gateways’ network or public IP. You’ll need to identify the actual network or IPs. E.g., not net 35.171.100.16/28 and not net X.X.X.X/X or not net 35.171.100.16/28 and not host X.X.X.X.

Trustgrid nodes are then assigned to networks. Virtual network overlays work similarly to Amazon’s VPCs but can span between clouds, data centers, and the edge.\nOverlay Example Virtual Networks - Layer 3 Trustgrid uses a virtual network to traffic between nodes. This avoids common challenges like conflicting subnets in large, non-centralized networks.\nInside and outside NATs are used to expose hosts for traffic\nRoutes may be configured on the nodes\nACLs can be applied\nSimple Host Communication An inside Nat on the edge node that maps 10.0.5.250 to 172.16.3.250 would allow the data center host (10.0.1.150) to communicate with 172.16.3.250 host using the address 10.0.5.250\nAn outside Nat on the edge node that maps 10.0.1.150 to 10.0.5.150 would allow the edge host (172.16.3.250) to communicate the data center host at 10.0.5.150.\nA route would have to be added to the default gateway of 172.16.3.0/24 for 10.0.5.150 to route traffic for 10.0.5.0/24 through the gw of the edge node (172.16.0.5) data interface.\nVirtual IP Addresses Through the use of inside and outside NAT rules, local IP addresses to the Trustgrid node may be exposed on the network through a Virtual IP Address. For instance, a local device may have a local IP address of 192.168.1.100, but you may want it to appear to other devices or applications on the virtual network as IP address 10.0.20.100. Virtual IP Subnets are also supported where each IP in a subnet is mapped to the corresponding IP in a virtual subnet.\nInside NAT Inside NATs are added to a network to expose hosts in the private network to authorized traffic in the virtual network. For example a host at 192.168.1.184/32 could be exposed as 172.16.1.184/32. Traffic from authorized edge nodes could then communicate with 172.16.1.184.\nOutside NAT The use of an outside NAT can eliminate the need to create routes on internal gateways. Outsides NATs translate address in edge (remote) private networks to a privately addressable local IP. For example a host at 172.16.10.184/32 could be translated to 192.168.1.184/32.\nRoutes Routes are used to specify the network interface to be used when accessing specific subnets.\n","categories":["concepts"],"description":"","excerpt":" Virtual networks define an overlay network and routes for layer 3 …","ref":"/docs/docs/domain/virtual-networks/","tags":["domain","concepts","rewrite"],"title":"Virtual Networks"},{"body":" A virtual network tunnel interface can be configured on a Trustgrid node or cluster to allow forwarding of traffic to a remote Trustgrid Node or Cluster that is attached to the same virtual network.
